This blog uses Jekyll. For documentation see <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">here</a>. 

Jekyll is best used for making static web sites and blogs. As you know we are hosted 
free on gh-pages, which is a free service provided by github.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Create a post on this website, you can find the source 
code <a href="https://github.com/foundersandcoders/saturday-taster">here</a>,
clone the repository on your local machine (in you case nitrous).


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
